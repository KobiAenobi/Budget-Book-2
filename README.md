# Budget Book 

So, Story Time, I spent around ₹6000 in a week, and I had no idea where it went. So I decided to track my budget from now on, BUT turns out it's a hassle using the 'Notes App', and other apps, as they are not "automatic" enough.
So here comes the idea:

An Android app for budget management that works with Google Pay.

Basically, I wanted an app that will automatically open when I complete a transaction because it's a hassle to manually open a app and make and entry.
This app pops up an overlay bubble after a transaction, and all you have to do is enter name, quantity & price, and it will create a new entry.



## Installation Instructions

Now, sadly, if you want the automatic functionality, you have to jump through some hoops. Because the app uses accessibility settings for automatic detection of transaction completion and Lord Google doesn't like that, So:

You have to ADB sideload the APK file using Android Platform Tools(YouTube's your guy).
no way around it, at least not that I know of.

If you just want to use the basic budget management functionality, you can install it by disabling Play Protect for a sec. 
But then that's not really the point of the app, but it's still a cool app.
